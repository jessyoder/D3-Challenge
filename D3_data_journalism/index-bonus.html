          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Healthcare, Healthrisks, and Income</h2>
          <p>The correlations were a little bit different for each of the factors that I measured against Median Income,
            but they all seemed to have somewhat of a correlation.
          </p>

          <p>The first comparison I made was between median income and the percentage of people in a state who were living
            with a lack of adequate healthcare. It appears that states with higher median incomes have a pattern of having
            a lower percentage of people who have a lack of healthcare. In contrast, the states with lower median incomes tended
            to have a higher percentage of people living with a lack of adequate heathcare.</p>

          <p>The second comparison was between median income and the percentage of people in a state who smoke. There also
            seems to be a correlation in this area. The states with higher median incomes seem to have a lower percentage of people
            who smoke, while states with lower median incomes tend to have a higher percentage of smokers.</p>

          <p>The third comparison was between median income and obesity rate. Once again, the trend seems to be that higher median
            income in a state has a pattern of lower obesity rate, while lower median income trends more toward a higher percentage of
            people living with obesity.
          </p>

          <p>Although none of the three comparisons had a very strong correlation, there was definitely a subtle pattern between how
            a state's median income affects the quality of healthcare that states' citizens receive and the number of health risks that 
            states' citizens face. The states with higher median incomes tend to have a lower number of people who lack heathcare, as well
            as lower numbers of people who smoke and suffer from obesity. On the contrary, states with lower median incomes tended to have
            more people suffering from a lack of adequate healthcare and obesity and a higher number of people who smoke.
